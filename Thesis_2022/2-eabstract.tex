Writing automated web testing scripts mainly uses programs to simulate the situation of users operating web pages.
In order to determine whether the interactive components in the website are normally triggered, 
a part of change HTML content will be used as the judgment condition for the success of the interaction.
Testers make it difficult to find stable element constraints in more efficient way 
because components change rapidly or only focus on the current component changes.

This thesis proposes to use the HTML text comparison method to develop an browser extension package 
that use in the browser developer tools.
Testers can get all the differences in the panel of browser developer tools if detail of the element is changed because of interactive components.
In order to maintain HTML content after interacting and reduce unnecessary compared result, we designed with timing and filtering functions additionally.

The three major functions of the extension will allow developers to reduce the Xpath length 
and durability according to the results, thereby increasing the program stability.
