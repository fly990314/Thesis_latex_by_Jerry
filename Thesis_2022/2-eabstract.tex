Writing automated web testing scripts mainly uses programs to simulate the situation of users operating web pages.
In order to determine whether the interactive components in the website are normally triggered, 
a part of change HTML content will be used as the judgment condition for the success of the interaction.
Testers make it difficult to find the best element constraints in the most efficient way 
because components change rapidlu or only focus on the current component changes.

This thesis proposes to use the HTML text comparison method to develop an browser extension package 
that use in the "Browser Developer Tools".

Testers can get all the differences in the panel of "Browser Developer Tools" if detail of the element is changed because of interactive components.
In addition, timing and filtering functions are added in this extension, 
in order to avoid using the filtering function to filter redundant results when there are too many results, 
and use the timing function to maintain the accuracy of interactive results.

The three major functions of the extension will allow developers to reduce the Xpath length 
and durability according to the results, thereby increasing the program stability.
